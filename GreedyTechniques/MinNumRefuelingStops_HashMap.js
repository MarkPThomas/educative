// Develop a program to find the minimum number of refueling stops that a car needs to make to cover
// a distance, target.

// For simplicity, assume that the car has to travel from west to east in a straight line.
// There are various fuel stations on the way, which can be represented as a 2-D array of stations,
// i.e., stations[i] = [d_i ,f_i], where d_i is the distance in miles of the ith gas station from the
// starting position, and f_i is the amount of fuel in liters that it stores.

//  Initially, the car starts with k liters of fuel.

//  The car consumes one liter of fuel for every mile traveled.

//  Upon reaching a gas station, the car can stop and refuel using all the petrol stored at the station.

//  In case it cannot reach the target, the program simply returns âˆ’1.

// Note:
// If the car reaches a station with 0 fuel left, it can refuel from that station, and all the fuel
// from that station can be transferred to the car.

// If the car reaches the target with 0 fuel left, it is still considered to have arrived.
