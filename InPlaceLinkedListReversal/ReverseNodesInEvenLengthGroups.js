// Youâ€™re given a linked list. Your task is to reverse all of the nodes that are present in the
// groups with an even number of nodes in them.

// The nodes in the linked list are sequentially assigned to non-empty groups whose lengths form
// the sequence of the natural numbers (1,2,3,4...).

// The length of a group is the number of nodes assigned to it. In other words:

// The 1 st node is assigned to the first group.

// The 2 nd and 3 rd nodes are assigned to the second group.

// The 4 th, 5 th, and 6 th nodes are assigned to the third group and so on.

// You have to return the head of the modified linked list.

// Note: The length of the last group may be less than or equal to 1 + the length of the
// second to the last group.
